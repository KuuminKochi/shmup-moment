Still doing some house-cleaning.
Moved the constants to their own .rs file.
Still reworking on input parser; don't know if the new way of parsing will work as intended. But we'll see. [Refer to this](#Nt-2022/10/23-Dreamingtown-00).
Also added this README because i can. Maybe it will be useful

Current assumption: KeyboardInput reads everything including unpressed buttons
Untested, need to check again later.
Left this note in case something goes wrong related to the input parser

## TODOs (that we currently have in mind)
- [ ] 0. Clean-up until i (dreamingtown) think it's good enough
- [ ] 1. Test input parser
- [ ] 2. Test collider system
